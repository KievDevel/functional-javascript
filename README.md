## Imperative vs declarative

Imperative = **how**; list of instructions how to achieve result.

Declarative = **what**; only declaration of expected result

## Basic concepts

Why functional programming? It's provable by math and readable. 
But remember not go too far with it until you'll be confident in what you're doing.

**Procedure** - collection of operations; 
In simple words: functions return a value, whereas procedures don't.

**Pure functions** - functions with no side effects;
can't access parameters outside, given same input -> give same output.

You can wrap functions - so impure function will be hidden into pure function

Function with 1 parameter named unary function, with 2 - binary, if more - anyary function.
